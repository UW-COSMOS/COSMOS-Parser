sequestration in mineral soils and the interactions of
C with other nutrients (Cardon, 1996). Depending on
soil CfN ratio, the interactions of C and nitrogen (N) are
particularly important being N the nutrient most
commonly limiting plant and microbial growth and
soluble C the main energy source for microrganisms.
Terrestrial ecosystems response to C02 fertilization
is therefore linked to the knowledge of belowground
processes and particularly those performed by the
microbial pool (Zak et all, 2000) Microbiological
parameters related to soil weight are often correlated
or combined as an index in order to evaluate the
signi&#64257;cance of microbial populations and microbial
activity in the cycling of elements in soils of different
ecosystems in situ (Nannipieri, 1994). Brookes (1995)
recommends to combine microbial parameters in
order to have an &#8220;internal control&#8221; such as biomass C
as the percentage of soil organic matter. The same
author also reports that combining microbial activity
and population measurements (biomass speci&#64257;c
respiration or metabolic quotient) appears to provide
more sensitive indications of soil pollution than either
activity or population measurements alone (see also
Dilly and Munch, 1998). Ecophysiological indices
(metabolic quotients) are generated by basing phy-
siological performances (respiration, growth/death,
carbon uptake) on the total microbial biomass per unit
time. Any environmental impact which will affect
members of a microbial community should be
detectable at the community level by a change of a
particular total microbial community activity which
can be quanti&#64257;ed (qCOz, etc.) (Anderson, 2003).
The ratio of biomass C to soil organic C (Cmic :Corg)
reflects the contribution of microbial biomass to soil
organic carbon (Anderson and Domsch, 1989). It also
indicates the substrate availability to the soil microllora
or, in reverse, the fraction of recalcitrant organic matter
in the soil; in fact this ratio declines as the concentration
of available organic matter decreases (Brookes, 1995).
The qCOZ (the community respiration per biomass unit
or the metabolic quotient) has been widely used in
literature and is originally based on Odum&#8217;s theory of
ecosystem succession. Although its reliability as a</p><p>Fru-rr\~1mm&#64258;rvmrrnn~i.nr&#8212;1t&#8212;&#8216;r</p><p>a.</p><p>H1"-~AH(M~NHAQNP"_AF&#8212;t</p></div>

bioindicator of disturbance or ecosystem development
has been recently criticised by some authors, it is
recognized to have valuable application as a relative
measure of how ef&#64257;ciently the soil microbial biomass is</p></div>

and chemical properties, see Hoosbeck et a1. (2004).
The mean values of precipitation and temperature
(calculated over a period of 14 years, from meteor-
ological data collected at POPFACE site) are of 14.1 &#176;C
and 818mm, respectively. Clones of Populus alba,
Populux nigm and Populus &gt;&lt; ettramericrma were
grown, since 1999, in six 314 in2 plots treated either
with atmospheric (control) or enriched (550 umol
mol" C02) C02 concentration with FACE technology
(FreeAirCOz Enrichment).Eachplot isdivided into six
triangular sectors, with two sectors perpoplar genotype:
three species &gt;&lt; two nitrogen levels. Nitrogen fertiliza-
tion started in July 2002, it was executed once per week
during the growing season and lasted for 16 weeks.
Fertilizer was supplied weekly in constant dose to a
&#64257;nal total amount of 212 kg N ha". In the 2003
growing season the fertilizer was supplied weekly in
amounts proportional to the growth rate for 20 weeks
and provided a total amount of 290 kg N ha&#8212;l</p></div>

quotient) expresses the fraction of total organic carbon
mineralized throughout the incubation time (Dommere
gues, 1960; Pinzari et al., 1999). The qC (microbial
biomass change rate quotient) expresses the daily
enrichment or loss of soil microbial C and is calculated
based on qD as reported by Anderson and Domsch</p><p>(1990). In the present study Cmic:Corg, qCOZ, qM, qC
and inorganic nitrogen content were determined on soil
samples taken during 3 years (Fall ZOOO&#8212;Fa112003) in a
poplar plantation exposed to increased atmospheric
C02 by means of FACE (Free Air C02 Enrichment)
technique and fertilized during the last 2 years. Aim of
this paper was to assess the validity of the microbial
indiees as bioindicators of microbial processes induced
