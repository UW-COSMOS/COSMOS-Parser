      <div id="rawtext"><p>In many studies microbiological parameters were
correlated or combined as an index (Nannipieri, 1994).
Nevertheless ratios between microbiological para&#8212;
meters have often been used for evaluating the
microbial ecophysiology implying an interlinkage
between cell&#8212;physiological functioning under the
influence of environmental factors (Anderson, 2003).</p><p>In this study the responses of Cmic:Corg ratio,
qCOz (metabolic quotient) and qC (microbial change
rate quotient) to FACE and nitrogen fertilization
treatments, observed during 3 years, seemed to be
strongly affected by the nutritional statux of the soil. In
fact a strong reduction of soil inorganic nitrogen was
detected and it was probably due to enhanced plant
uptake linked to the increase of biomass under
elevated C02 as shown by Calfapietra et al. (2003).
The microbial pool is strongly dependent on nitrogen
and probably suffered from a competition with plants
for this element (Allen and Schlesinger, 2004) This
nutritional &#8220;stress&#8221; could explain the decrease of
Cmic:Corg ratio, in not fertilized plots, to values lower
than 2.0 which is considered a critical threshold for
soils with neutral pH (Anderson, 2003). Moreover, it is
reasonable to assume that a nutritional unbalance
between C and N may have altered the physiological
state of microbes with changes in microbial size over
time. The decrease of qC after fertilization suggests an
improvement of microbial nutritional conditions as
nitrogen in easily available forms was provided.</p><p>Anderson (2003) refers to the same critical value,
mentioned for Cmic:Corg, also with reference to
qCOz, af&#64257;rming that values higher than 2.0 of
metabolic quotient indicate an energetically less
ef&#64257;cient microbial community. Changes in nutrient
availability can modify microbial maintenance energy
requirements. The low CmiczCorg and the high qCOz
reflect a less efficient use of organic substrates bv</p></div>

cally expensive process particularly when microbes
are forced to degrade stable SOM to get new available
substrates. qCO2 decreases under FACE treatment but
this reduction is more pronounced when both
treatments (FACE and N fertilization) are applied.
In fact, in FACE+N plots, C and N are easily
available in soil, therefore a more ef&#64257;cient use of
energy in nutrient acquisition activity is permitted.</p><p>In elevated C02 environments it is assumed that,
because of faster root turnover or increased production
of root exudates, more C is available for microbes
(Cardon, 1996; Cheng, 1999; Schortmeyer et al.,
2000). In another study that we performed at
POPFACE experimental station, elevated C02
induced a signi&#64257;cant increase of soil labile carbon
fractions (+19% of water soluble carbon and + 21% of
KZSO4&#8212;extractable carbon) indicating a &#64258;ux of soluble
C forms that could lead to the microbial immobiliza-
tion process observed (Moscatelli et al., in press). We
can therefore hypothesize that, in our experimental
conditions, the extra C made available for microbes
has been used to build up more microbial biomass as
the signi&#64257;cant increase of microbial quotient under
FACE treatment suggests.</p><p>The response of microbial respiration to nitrogen
fertilization was signi&#64257;cant in the &#64257;rst 24h of
incubation, panicularly in June 2003 when the highest
increase of this parameter was recorded. At this purpose
it should be considered that June 2003 was j ust 1 month
after the beginning of the fertilization and this could be
the reason for the consistent &#64257;ushofCOz measured. It is
well known that a sudden increase of C02 output from
soil is generally observed after the addition of easily
available organic substrates or of inorganic nitrogen
fertilizers to the soil. This phenomenon, the so&#8212;called
priming effect, is due to an increase of microbial
activity resulting in an acceleration of soil organic
matter mineralization as substrate and energy source
(Kuzyakov et al., 2000). The addition of inorganic
nitrogen could have provoked, likewise, a short-term
selection inside the microbial community in favour of
microrganisms more ef&#64257;cient in the use of the nutrient
resources. To support this hypothesis we have evidence
that microbial biomass C/N ratio decreased signi&#64257;-
cantly in June 2003 after fertilization by 61% in
control + N and 48% in FACE + N indicating a shift
towards bacterial communities (data not shown).</p></div>
