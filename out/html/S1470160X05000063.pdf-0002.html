ammonium and nitrate: ammonium was extracted in
1 M KC1 and was determined following Anderson and
Ingram (1993) while nitrate was determined color-
imetrically after extraction in 0.5 M K2304 (Cataldo
et al., 1975). Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was
estimated following the Fumigation Extraction (FE)
method: two portions of moist soil (20 goven-dry soil)
were weighed, the &#64257;rst one (non-fumigated) was
immediately extracted with 80 ml of0.5 M K2304 for
30 min by oscillating shaking at 200 rpm and &#64257;ltered
(Whatman no. 42); the second one was fumigated for
24 h at 25 &#176;C with ethanol-free CHCl3 and then
extracted as described above. Organic C in the extracts
was determined after oxidation with 0.4 N KZCrZO7 at
100 &#176;C for 30 min (Vance et al., 1987). Microbial
biomass was calculated as follows: biomass C :
Ec:kEc, where EC is the difference between organic C
extracted from fumigated soils and organic C
extracted from non-fumigated soils and kEC=0.38.
POPFACE soil characteristics allow the use of this
factor since caution is required in soils recently
amended with organic matter (Harden et al., 1993a), in
waterlogged soils (Inubushi et al., 1991) and in
organic layers of forest soils (Scholle et al., 1992). For
measuring microbial respiration 20 g (oven-dry basis)
of moist sample were placed in 1 l stoppered glass jars.</p></div>

soil cores in not fertilized subiplots from October
2000 until October 2001 and 72 soil cores from June
2002 to October 2003 in fertilized and not fertilized
subiplots, In June 2002 soil samples were collected
also in fertilized subiplots although the addition of
nitrogen started the following month, however data
related to these samples are not considered in the
calculation of the fertilization effect. Soil samples
