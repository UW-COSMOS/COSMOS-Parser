due to the different poplar species, data from different
poplar genotypes were pooled together. When inter-
actions were not signi&#64257;cant they were excluded from
analy. s. In the results section the effect of FACE and/
or fertilization treatments has been reported as
percentage variation with respect to the control. It
has been calculated on the average values of all
sampling dates for FACE effect and from October
2002 for the fertilization effect: June 2002 is, in fact,
not included since fertilization was started the</p><p>following month. All statistical analysis were per-

treatment reduced inorganic nitrogen availability,
during the whole period of study, with respect to
control plots (&#8212;20%, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 1A). The
fertilization produced a signi&#64257;cant increase of soil
inorganic nitrogen (+123% in FACE and +160% in
control plots, p &lt; 0.001) although itdid notre-establish
the original values of October 2000 (Fig. 1A and
Table 1).</p><p>The trend of microbial quotient (Cmic:Corg ratio),
during the 3 years of observation, parallels the trend
of inorganic nitrogen, as also shown by the linear
regression on these two parameters in Fig. 2.
Cmic:Corg signi&#64257;cantly decreases after the &#64257;rst year
and assesses its value to less than 2% until the end of
2003 (Table 1). However, although the contribution of
microbial biomass to total organic carbon is very low
in this soil, FACE treatment induced a signi&#64257;cant
increase of Cmic:Corg ratio in not fertilized plots
(+35%, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 1B).</p></div>
